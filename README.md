## Digital Holographic microscopy and Python
Holograms are Interferences, circular pattern of bright and dark lines surrounding an object due to light passage over it in 2D plane. These patterns contains 3 dimensional information of the object and computationally possible to reconstruct/simulate. This is a simple way of imaging micrometer size tiny objects such as microorganism or bio molecules without any optical lenses and has immense application in microscopy.  Holopy, a python package which gives an inference method of simulating 3d information from digital holograms. Objective of the poster is to introduce the holopy and demonstrate 3d simulation of 2-5 micrometer size particles from holographic image using Python code base. It also discuss the application of holographic microscopy combined with machine learning for air pollution monitoring.
